        <p id="wikipage"><b><i>Helen Hannah Campbell (August 15, 1916 â€“ March 24, 2013) </i></b> <br> <!--break--> <b>was a chaperone in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League for the Muskegon Lassies between 1947 and 1949.</b> In that capacity, she "arranged their housing, uniforms, got their paychecks, arranged the buses. But they really accepted me more like a buddy. If they wanted to go out and get a burger and a beer, I'd go with them."[1]

            Born in Whittier, California to parents James and Helen, Helen's nickname was Chappie. She lived in Fountain Valley for more than four-and-a-half decades, taking an active role in her community, like her work for the Retired Senior Volunteers at the Fountain Valley Police Department. In addition, she sat on the Pacific Coast League Historical Society Board of Directors as well as participating in both the California Angels Booster Club and Anaheim Stadium. She remained with the team until the Korean War since she was called to active duty for the Marine Corps.</p>
